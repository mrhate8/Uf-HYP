- ## First Step
###### First of all we need After Effects (a.k.a AF) and the increbile, magnificent "[BODYMOVIN](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/)" to bake our (presumably) fantastic animation.
###### NOW!...Open AF and create your composition (I've created all the component with Illustrator)

![step1](https://github.com/mrhate8/Uf-HYP/blob/master/img/img1.jpg)



- ## Second Step
###### Go in "Window" - "Extantion" and select "Bodymovin".
###### After that select your composition, choose a destination folder and in the settings check "Glyphs" and "Demo" (if you want have in HTML preview). Now it's time to press the RENDER button!

###### Now that we got our "data.json" file, we need the "player" for our animation.



- ## Third Step
###### Press the "Get The Player" button on Bodymovin and press it again in the next step.

###### aaand now the player is in our hand!

- ## Fourth Step
###### All the ingredients are now ready to get prepared for final (and maybe "hard") part of the recipe.
